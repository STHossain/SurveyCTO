. 
. * ENUMERATOR, TEAMS, BACK CHECKERS
. * Enumerator variable
. local enum "deviceid"

. * Enumerator Team variable
. //local enumteam ""
. * Back checker variable
. local bcer "simid"

. 
. * DATASETS
. * The original dataset 
. local orig_dta "3.0 survey data.dta" 

. * The original backcheck dataset 
. local bc_dta "6.0 backcheck data.dta" 

. * Note that the next two datasets are created for clarity - 
. * Normally you just save replace on the above datasets 
. * The new checked and deduped  dataset that will be used for the comparison
. local orig_dta_cd "9.3 survey data, checked and deduped.dta" 

. * The new checked and deduped backcheck dataset that will be used for the comparison
. local bc_dta_cd "9.4 backcheck data, checked and deduped.dta" 

. 
. * Unique ID*
. local id "consentedid" 

. 
. * VARIABLE LISTS
. * Type 1 Vars: These should not change. They guage whether the enumerator 
. * performed the interview and whether it was with the right respondent. 
. * If these are high, you must discuss them with your field team and consider
. * disciplinary action against the surveyor and redoing her/his interviews.
. 
. local t1vars "consentedfavfruit consentedage" 

. 
. * Type 2 Vars: These are difficult questions to administer, such as skip 
. * patterns or those with a number of examples. The responses should be the  
. * same, though respondents may change their answers. Discrepanices should be 
. * discussed with the team and may indicate the need for additional training.
. 
. local t2vars "enumeratorcomment" 

. 
. * Type 3 Vars: These are key outcomes that you want to understand how 
. * they're working in the field. These discrepancies are not used
. * to hold surveyors accountable, but rather to gauge the stability 
. * of the measure and how well your survey is performing. 
. 
. local t3vars "consentedfavveg1" 

. 
. * Variables from the backcheck that you want to see in the outputted .csv, 
. * but not compare.
. 
. *local keepbc "" 
. 
. * Variables from the original survey that you want to see in the 
. * outputted .csv, but not compare.
. 
. *local keepsurvey "" 
. 
. 
. * STABILITY TESTS*
. * Type 3 Variables that are continuous. The stability check is a ttest.
. *local ttest "varname" 
. * Type 3 Variables that are discrete. The stability check uses signrank.
. *local signrank "varname" 
. 
. * VALUES TO EXCLUDE*
. * Set the values that you do not wanted included in the comparison
. * if a backcheck variable has this value. These responses will not affect
. * error rates and will not appear in the outputted .csv. Typically, you'll
. * only use this only when the back check check data set has data for multiple
. * back check versions.
. 
. //local exclude_num ""
. //local exclude_str ""

. **********************************************************************
. *Step 2: Assembling and cleaning the original data, if necessary
. **********************************************************************
. * Clean duplicates and id's
. * Assemble into one data set against which to compare the backcheck data
.  clear

.  use "8.2 survey data, checked.dta" 

.  drop if dup == 1 
(0 observations deleted)

.  drop if consentedid == . 
(1 observation deleted)

.  save "9.3 survey data, checked and deduped.dta", replace 
file 9.3 survey data, checked and deduped.dta saved

. 
. **********************************************************************
. *Step 2: Assembling and cleaning the backcheck data
. **********************************************************************
. * Rename vars from the backcheck to match the original survey, if necessary
. * Clean duplicates and id's
. * Assemble into one data set
.  clear 

.  use "6.0 backcheck data.dta" 

.  drop if consentedid == . 
(1 observation deleted)

.  save "9.4 backcheck data, checked and deduped.dta", replace 
file 9.4 backcheck data, checked and deduped.dta saved

. 
. **********************************************************************
. *Step 3: Compare the backcheck and original data
. **********************************************************************
. * Run the comparison
. * Make sure to specify the enumeratorm enumerator team and backchecker vars.
. * Select the options that you want to use, i.e. okrate, okrange, full, filename  
. * This is the code that we think will be the most applicable across projects.
. * Feel free to edit and add functionality.
