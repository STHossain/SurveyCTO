CAI with SurveyCTO
==================
Instructors: Lindsey Shaughnessy and Christopher Boyer
Location: Camp Yevneh, New Hampshire, USA.
Dates: 24 - 28 August 2015

Welcome to the *CAI with SurveyCTO* course sequence for the 2015 JPAL/IPA
Global Staff Training in New Hampshire. Included in this folder you will find
all the files and programs necessary to complete the full course sequence, including:

1. Data Collection with CAI
2. Basics of ODK/SurveyCTO
3. Intermediate ODK/SurveyCTO
4. Respondent tracking with SurveyCTO
5. Data quality assurance

Where possible we have tried to make the layout of files and folder adhere as closely
as possible to the structure of the course. In large directories we've linearized
file names (i.e. prepended numbers indicating their relative order).
